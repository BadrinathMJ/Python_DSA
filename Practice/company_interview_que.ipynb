    "\n",
    "On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string \"{function_id}:{\"start\" | \"end\"}:{timestamp}\". For example, \"0:start:3\" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and \"1:end:2\" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i."

    "Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.\n",
