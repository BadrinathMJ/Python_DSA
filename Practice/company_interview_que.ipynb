    "There are n bricks arranged in a row at positions numbered from 1 through n, inclusive. There is an array, newtons[n], that contains an integer indicating the number of newtons required to smash a brick. (A newton is a unit of force.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two hammers, one big and one small. The big hammer can smash any brick with one blow. The small hammer reduces the newtons required by 1 for each blow to a brick. For example, a brick requires 3 newtons of force. It will take 1 blow with the big hammer, or 3 blows with the small hammer to smash it. There is a limit to how many times the big hammer can be used.\n",
