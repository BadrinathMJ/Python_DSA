    "There are two hammers, one big and one small. The big hammer can smash any brick with one blow. The small hammer reduces the newtons required by 1 for each blow to a brick. For example, a brick requires 3 newtons of force. It will take 1 blow with the big hammer, or 3 blows with the small hammer to smash it. There is a limit to how many times the big hammer can be used.\n",
